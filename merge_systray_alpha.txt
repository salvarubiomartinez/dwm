It's a problem with XFillRectangle. The alpha patch changes the definition of drw->gc in drw.c. So when XFillRectangle is called in updatesystray the wrong value is passed.

You can remedy this by changing the call from

XFillRectangle(dpy, systray->win, drw->gc, 0, 0, w, bh);

to

XFillRectangle(dpy, systray->win, XCreateGC(dpy, root, 0 ,1 NULL), 0, 0, w, bh);
